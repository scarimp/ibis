Site styles for rosslaird.com
=============================

This repository is provided primarily for my students, but is open to anyone
who wishes to view the styles (CSS) that I use at rosslaird.com. I have also
included various Javascript files, images, and site-specific files I use to
deploy my site using Mezzanine_.

If you building a site with Mezzanine_, you should be aware that this
repository represents a theme application and should live as an application
inside your Mezzanine project. (Please consult the Mezzanine docs_ for more
information.) You should also be aware that the CSS file included in this
repository is designed to work with the templates provided by Mezzzanine and
the styles provided by the Twitter Bootstrap_ framework. (The basic Bootstrap
theme can be modified using Bootswatch_.)

Web design is a rapidly-evolving and highly complex area. If you are one of my
students, and you wish to experiment with the CSS styles or Javascripts
included in this repository, please do so. Just clone the repository (``git
clone`` followed by the url of the repository should do it; or you can just
copy the files as you like). But please do not simply copy and paste snippets
of code into a live website (such as your blog). That would be unwise, and
would probably have unintended (and bad) consequences. Instead, use these
files on your local machine to experiment, play, learn, break, rebuild, and
explore. And, if you have trouble, ask me in class.
